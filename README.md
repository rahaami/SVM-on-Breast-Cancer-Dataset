# SVM-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
Applying SVM on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
The provided code implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch and addresses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset exploration. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries and modules, including numpy, pandas, and train_test_split from scikit-learn. Then loads the dataset from a URL, defining a custom SVM to the training data and predicting the labels for the testing data, by using gradient descent for optimization and supports binary classification. The hyperparameters for the SVM (learning rate, lambda parameter, and number of iterations) are specified in the class constructor. The SVM model is instantiated, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the testing data. The accuracy of the model is computed and printed. Furthermore, various performance metrics are calculated using scikit-learn's metrics module, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix in order to evaluation of the model's performance. The code includes a visualization component using matplotlib, that plots histograms of the mean radius and mean texture features from the dataset. Finally, the code computes the confusion matrix, extracts its components (true negatives, false positives, false negatives, and true positives), and prints them in a tabular format. Moreover, the code also measures the "wall-clock" time it takes to execute by using the time module.
